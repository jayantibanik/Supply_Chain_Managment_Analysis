# Supply_Chain_Managment_Analysis

**- Introduction**

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of supply chain operations, covering production, orders, revenue, supplier performance, costs, and shipping. It helps businesses track key KPIs, monitor efficiency, and identify areas for improvement in the supply chain process.

**- Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualisation platform used for report creation.
- 🔄 Power Query – Used for cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw supply chain data.
- 📐 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied for calculated measures, conditional logic, and dynamic visuals.
- 🖼 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard preview.

**- 📂 Data Source**

The dataset was provided by Unified Mentor during my internship. It contains supply chain performance data in CSV format.

**- Highlights**
